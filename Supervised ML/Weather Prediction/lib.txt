from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split 
# This function is used to split the dataset into training set and testing set. 
# The training set is used to train the model, while the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance.

from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression 
# Logistic Regression is a Machine Learning classification algorithm that is used to predict the probability of a categorical dependent variable. 
# In logistic regression, the dependent variable is a binary variable that contains data coded as 1 (yes, success, etc.) or 0 (no, failure, etc.).

from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder, StandardScaler 
# LabelEncoder is a utility class to help normalize labels such that they contain only values between 0 and n_classes-1. 
# This is useful for making outputs from machine learning match up to categories.
# StandardScaler standardizes features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance. 
# The standard score of a sample x is calculated as: z = (x - u) / s, where u is the mean and s is the standard deviation.

import pandas as pd 
# pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. 
# In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.
